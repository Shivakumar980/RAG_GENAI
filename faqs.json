        "question": "When is tuition due?",
        "answer": "The tuition payment deadline is generally the second Friday of each semester as posted on the Academic Calendar at registrar.fsu.edu. Check studentfinance.fsu.edu for upcoming deadlines. Classes added after the drop/add period must be paid within five calendar days to avoid late fees."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why don't I receive a bill in the mail?",
        "answer": "Your bill is available online through your my.fsu.edu Student Center. Electronic billing is more efficient and more accurate than paper statements since your myFSU account statement will update if you change your class schedule and after you receive a financial aid disbursement. The total tuition due is available online when you register for classes, and is also online in detail on your Account Statement at my.fsu.edu."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have financial aid, but I owe tuition. Do I need a deferment?",
        "answer": "As long as you apply for financial aid on time (FSU recommends applying each year on Oct 1) and turn in any requested documents to the Financial Aid Office quickly and at least two weeks before the advertised early disbursement date, then you should not need a deferment. Review the Office of Financial Aid's checklists to be sure you are disbursement ready. If you apply for financial aid timely, then your financial aid should process at the beginning of the term, just before classes start or on the fifth day of class, which is before the fee payment deadline. Sometimes students and families ask about a deferment when they are unsure how financial aid payments work. In short, FSU applies financial aid payments to your FSU bill first and then refunds any excess payment to you.\n\nIf your financial aid is delayed, then the Office of Financial Aid will place a deferment on your account, temporarily postponing your tuition due date. You will receive an email at your official FSU address when your financial aid pays or if you are granted an automatic deferment.\n\nPlease check your FSU bill during the second week of class to be sure that your tuition and fees are paid in full or deferred. Many students make schedule changes during the first week of classes that change the bill and can change financial aid awards (which adjust to schedule changes on the fifth day of classes), so there are several important reasons to double-check your FSU bill during the second week of classes. If your financial aid does not disburse in full and you are not informed of an automatic deferment during the second week of classes, then please contact the Office of Financial Aid regarding your status (financialaid@fsu.edu or 850-644-0539). If you have questions about your bill or where a refund was sent, then please contact the Office of Student Finance at studentfinance@fsu.edu.\n\nIf you applied for financial aid before the start of the semester but were not automatically granted a deferment, then you may be eligible to apply for a deferment by contacting the Office of Student Finance. Your tuition must be paid in full or deferred by the Tuition Payment Deadline, or you will incur late fees and risk schedule cancellation."

        "question": "How can I pay for my tuition?",
        "answer": "Online - Transact allows students, faculty, staff, and guests to pay for charges on their accounts in the MyFSU Student Central system. Transact accepts most major credit cards, ACH/Electronic Check, and International Wires through Western Union Business Solutions. Payments are assessed a service fee to cover the costs associated with these transactions and to allow FSU to offer this option, as provided by state law (Florida Statute, Chapter 1009.23(15)). There is no fee to pay by e-check. Check here for more information regarding service fees. If you need technical assistance accessing this service, please contact the FSU Technology Services Help Desk at 850-644-4357.\n\nMail – Please make your check payment payable to FSU and mail it to: Office of Student Finance; A1500 University Center; Tallahassee, FL 32306-2394. Be sure to include your student number or FSUID, name, address, and telephone number on your check. Checks must be made out correctly to be considered on time. Tuition payment must be received by the tuition payment deadline or you will receive late fees and risk schedule cancellation.\n\nIn person - A secure payment drop box (night depository) is located outside the Office of Student Finance at A1500 University Center. The drop box is accessible any time for payment by check. All payments will be receipted by the next business day.

        "question": "Do you offer a payment plan for tuition?",
        "answer": "FSU offers two payment plans: The Traditional Installment Plan, which splits your tuition payment in half for a $15 fee, and the Graduate Assistant Tuition Plan, which allows deferment of the due date for tuition and fees until the end of the term. For more details, visit the Payment Plan pages on the FSU website."

    {
        "question": "I have Bright Futures and want to pay my fees early. What do I owe?",
        "answer": "Bright Futures pays a per-credit rate. The total bill minus the Bright Futures amount will give you the remaining balance. For example, the Medallion Scholarship pays $160.16 per credit hour, and the Academic Scholarship pays $213.55 per credit hour. Visit the Bright Futures page for more information."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am relying on other means to pay a portion of my bill. How do I pay a partial amount?",
        "answer": " Florida Prepaid and financial aid should post to your my.fsu.edu bill by the end of the first week of classes, which is before the fee payment deadline. To pay early, or to split your payment for some other reason—simply follow the 'make a payment' link visible through the main my.fsu.edu portal page, or under your myFSU account statement, to be sent to the Transact website. Once you are in Transact, Click the 'Make a payment' button. On the next step, choose the charge you want to pay and enter the amount into the text box that you would like to pay. Follow the prompts until the payment has been submitted."

        "answer": " Please contact the FSU ITS Helpdesk at 850-644-4357 for help accessing your myFSU account. Your network's firewall might be blocking the transaction. Please note that difficulty accessing the web system is not a valid excuse for missing payment deadlines. Students are responsible for making all payments on time and will be held liable for any penalties that may be associated with missing the tuition payment deadline. Please contact us to explore other options if you continue to experience difficulty online."

        "question": "Can I still give third-party access to an individual to allow them to pay my tuition, i.e. parents, spouses, siblings, etc.?",
        "answer": " Federal privacy laws require us to obtain your written permission to discuss your account details with any third parties, including your parents or spouse. Grant this permission by adding account delegates. To add a delegate, log into my.fsu.edu and access your Student Center (the 'SC' icon). Click the 'My Info' tile. Then select the 'Share My Information' tab on the left side of the page to assign a delegate.

    {
        "question": "Who do I talk to about my financial aid?",
        "answer": " The Office of Financial Aid deals with eligibility and awarding of financial aid. The Office of Student Finance processes payments and issues refunds. The Financial Aid Office will schedule your award and the Office of Student Finance will apply your financial aid to your myFSU bill—and refund any excess to you—once it arrives. The Financial Aid Office (850-644-0539 or financialaid@fsu.edu) is your best contact for questions regarding your financial aid status or the details of your financial aid award while Office of Student Finance is better positioned to discuss your myFSU bill and any refunds that have been issued to you."
    },
    {
        "question": "I was offered one amount for Bright Futures, but I received less. Where is my extra money??",
        "answer": " Bright Futures pays per credit hour and the award amount listed prior to disbursement is an approximation based upon an assumed 15-hour course load. You might receive less Bright Futures than estimated if you enrolled in fewer than 15 credit hours. Additionally, if you drop a class after Bright Futures pays, then your Bright Futures award will reduce and you will have to repay that portion of your award through your FSU bill. If you added classes after financial aid disbursed, you may wish to complete the Appeal of Hours form through the Office of Financial Aid."
    },
    {
        "question": "I was supposed to receive financial aid, but it is not on my account. Where is my financial aid?",
        "answer": " First, check your Account Statement to verify whether your funds were disbursed. Your financial aid might have been used to pay outstanding charges. The Account Statement 'activity tab' lists all of your charges and payments by date, including financial aid payments, and might prove a helpful place to look. The Office of Student Finance (850-644-9452 or studentfinance@fsu.edu) can help you to review your bill and payment details. If you do not see record of your financial aid posting to your Account Statement, then check the financial aid disbursement date. FSU always waits until the specified disbursement date for each term to disburse financial aid. Find specific dates on the Office of Student Finance Calendar. If the financial aid disbursement date has passed, double-check your Financial Aid Award listed at my.fsu.edu. If the listed amount matches your expectations, verify that you do not have a hold on your aid. You can review financial aid holds through the 'to do list' at my.fsu.edu. If there is a hold, you will need to follow the instructions listed on your 'to do list'. If no holds are listed or you are expecting more financial aid than myFSU states, please contact the Office of Financial Aid (850-644-0539)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does disbursement mean?",
        "answer": " Disbursement generally refers to the application of financial aid payments to a student's FSU bill. Some students will end up with a refund after financial aid pays, while many other students might not. Students who are expecting a financial aid refund are probably more interested in the refund timeline, so that is what many students think of when asking about 'disbursement.' As a general practice, the refund process generally completes two business days after financial aid posts to the FSU bill and by then refund checks are usually in the mail and direct deposits have been transferred (though deposit processing times vary by bank). Be sure to enroll in direct deposit to get your refund quickly. Though financial aid disburses throughout the term, the biggest disbursement dates are planned for the start of term. Find these dates and more disbursement information at studentfinance.fsu.edu."
    },
    {
        "question": "When will I get my financial aid refund?",
        "answer": " You will receive a refund if your financial aid award is greater than the charges that can be paid with financial aid on your myFSU bill. Be sure to enroll in direct deposit so we know where to send your refund. Refunds are sent out two business days after we apply funds to your myFSU bill. Please note that deposit processing times vary by bank and some banks might take an extra business day or two to make your direct deposit available to you. Find planned refund dates on the Office of Student Finance calendar."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is early disbursement?",
        "answer": " 'Early Disbursement' is a means of receiving your financial aid earlier than you typically would. In order to ensure that our students have the funds they need, when they need them, the university has elected to disburse financial aid before the start of the term. Students who are eligible for financial aid disbursements before the early disbursement cutoff will receive the majority of their aid early in the first week of classes, rather than the second week."
    },
    {
        "question": "Will I get all of my Financial Aid early?",
        "answer": "Most financial aid is eligible for early disbursement -- so long as the student receiving the aid is also eligible (e.g. student registered for at least six credits during the normal registration window, accepted or declined all awards on time and does not have any outstanding documents or 'to do list' items due to the Office of Financial Aid). The following types of financial aid, however, generally cannot be disbursed early: Athletic Aid, Florida Student Assistance Grant, Florida Benacquisto (Florida Incentive Scholarship), First Generation Grant, Financial Aid for Children of Deceased / Disabled Veterans, Perkins Loans for First-time Borrowers. These funds will be disbursed on the traditional financial aid disbursement date during the second week of classes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I make sure I get my financial aid as quickly as possible?",
        "answer": "Enroll in direct deposit by providing your bank account information and register for classes early. You don't have to 'sign-up' to receive disbursements early, you just have to be registered and otherwise eligible by the early disbursement cutoff to qualify to receive your financial aid early. Remember: Most types of financial aid require that you be enrolled in a minimum of six hours to receive funding. Also, be sure that you check your 'to do list' early and submit any requested documents to the Financial Aid Office early enough before the start of term to allow sufficient time for review. Review the Office of Financial Aid Checklists for more information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What's the fastest way to get my financial aid refund?",
        "answer": "Enroll in direct deposit! Visit the Office of Student Finance Financial Aid Payments page for more information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What if I want to change my Schedule during Drop/Add and am receiving financial aid?",
        "answer": "You will need to be mindful of the type of aid that you have received before deciding to drop or add classes during the drop/add period. If your financial aid pays before drop/add then you might have to return all or a portion of your award if you make changes to your schedule that affect your eligibility. Most types of financial aid require a minimum enrollment of six (6) hours. Students who received federal aid and who drop below six hours will be required to return the funds to the school. Some awards, like Bright Futures or Federal Pell Grants, pay a per-credit or pro-rated amount based on enrollment and you might have to repay a portion of these awards if you drop a class, even when you remain above six credits."
    },
    {
        "question": "What if I want to cancel all of my Enrollment after receiving financial aid?",
        "answer": "Students who wish to cancel their enrollment before the end of the drop/add window may do so by dropping all of their classes, but must bear in mind that their financial aid disbursements will need to be returned to the university. Students who wish to cancel their entire scheduled after the drop/add period will need to go through the traditional withdrawal process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What if I have Florida Prepaid and Financial Aid?",
        "answer": "Florida Prepaid will reflect on your FSU bill early so that the portion Florida Prepaid is expected to pay will not be deducted from your financial aid. Before financial aid pays, you will see that a portion of your class fees have been covered by Florida Prepaid. When your financial aid disburses, it pays towards the portion of your FSU bill not covered by Florida Prepaid. Then, any excess financial aid will refund to you, generally 2-3 business days after disbursement."
    },
    {
        "question": "If my Tuition is paid by my Department, how will that work?",
        "answer": "Departmental waiver and billing entry will typically end three to four days before the early disbursement cutoff. If your department is not able to enter your waiver or billing in time you will receive a credit once they have."
    },
    {
        "question": "I'm on a Sponsored Billing, how does that work?",
        "answer": "Students who are sponsored by their employers, government agencies, should submit their billing documentation to the Office of Student Finance by the day before the early disbursement cutoff."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if all of my charges aren't on file before financial aid Disbursement?",
        "answer": "If you elect to purchase services after the early disbursement date—such as meal plans, or health insurance, these charges will be added to your student account and will have to be paid during subsequent disbursements or out of pocket. Your bill and financial aid awards might also change if you change your schedule during drop/add. The Office of Student Finance will send regular invoices, and your future registration, diploma, or transcripts may be held until all charges are settled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a Financial Aid Deferment?",
        "answer": "If your financial aid is delayed for reasons outside of your control, FSU will temporarily defer your tuition deadline for the affected term. Find the fee payment deadline, and deferral end dates, on the academic calendar. State of Florida rules allow the deferral of tuition fees for students receiving financial aid when the aid is delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the student. The failure to make timely application for the aid is an insufficient reason to receive a deferment of fees. In order to receive a deferment, you must have submitted all required documents to the Financial Aid Office prior to the beginning of the semester."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I get a financial aid deferment?",
        "answer": "You can request a deferment by submitting a ticket to the Office of Student Finance. These deferments are posted automatically on the fifth day of the term for students whose financial aid is known to be delayed for reasons outside of the student's control. You will be notified by email if you are granted a financial aid deferment. If you are not granted an automatic deferment on the fifth day of class, but your financial aid is delayed for reasons outside of your control, then be sure to request a deferment by emailing the Office of Student Finance before the fee payment deadline. Financial aid students who are not eligible to receive the deferment must pay in full by the posted deadline. You should check the status of your financial aid regularly and that you complete any 'To Do List' items through your Student Central web page before the term begins. Students granted a deferment must pay their tuition by the deferment deadline or risk incurring a late payment fee and being dropped from classes. All Financial Aid Deferments expire according to the deadline posted on the academic calendar and there is no further extension available."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I know if my financial aid has been disbursed?",
        "answer": "You will be notified by email when your financial aid disburses, though you can also check your myFSU bill for details. Review your financial aid disbursements through the 'Transactions' section of the 'Activity' tab under 'Account Inquiry.'"

The written release may be mailed, faxed, or emailed. You will find the contact information below: Mailing Address: Private Scholarships A1500 University Center Tallahassee, FL 32306-2398 Email: Sandra Maroney - smaroney@fsu.edu Fax number: 850-644-1822 Attn: Sandra Maroney - 850-644-5098."

    {
        "question": "I received a private scholarship for the fall term. My housing bill is due now. How do I use my private scholarship to pay for my housing?",
        "answer": "Private scholarship funds cannot be disbursed before that term's disbursement date. You would need to contact the Housing Department at 850-644-2860 to see if you qualify for a housing deferment in order to have your payment deferred to the fall disbursement date."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I use my private scholarship to pay for my tuition?",
        "answer": "Your private scholarship will automatically disburse and pay first for outstanding tuition.

    },
    {
        "question": "Why hasn't my private scholarship disbursed?",
        "answer": "Financial Aid is applied to your myFSU bill at the beginning of the term—generally by the fifth (5) day of class. If it is after the fifth day of class and your scholarship has still not posted to your myFSU bill, please check with your donor to confirm when and where they sent your scholarship check. If you are enrolled in fewer than twelve (12) credit hours, we will need to receive written approval from your donor to disburse your scholarship. Be sure to request this paperwork from your donor early if you plan on taking fewer than six credits to ensure that your financial aid disburses as early as possible."
